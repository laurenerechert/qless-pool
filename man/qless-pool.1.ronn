qless-pool(1) -- qless worker pool management
================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`qless-pool` [options]

## DESCRIPTION

**Qless-pool** is the best way to manage a group (pool) of qless workers.

When qless-pool(1) is daemonized the `stdout` and `stderr` output streams
are redirected to `qless-pool.stdxxx.log` log files in the `log` directory.
Additionally the PID file defaults to `qless-pool.pid` in the `tmp/pids`
directory.

## OPTIONS

  * `-c, --config` <file>:
    Uses the configuration specified in the <file> provided instead of
    searching in the current and `config` directories for `qless-pool.yml`.

  * `-a, --appname` <name>:
    Specifies the app name to be used for logging and procline.  If not
    specified, this defaults to the current working directory.

  * `-d, --daemon`:
    Runs `qless-pool` in the background as a daemon process. This will
    redirect `stdout` and `stderr` to log files and write a PID file.

  * `-o, --stdout` <file>:
    Writes the normal log output to <file> instead of printing to the
    terminal. When running as a daemon this defaults to the path
    `log/qless-pool.stdout.log`.

  * `-e, --stderr` <file>:
    Writes the standard error output to <file> instead of printing to the
    terminal. When running as a daemon this defaults to the path
    `log/qless-pool.stderr.log`.

  * `--nosync`
    Allows writes to `stdout` and `stderr` to be buffered.

  * `-p, --pidfile` <file>:
    Writes the PID to the <file>. When running as a daemon this defaults
    to `tmp/pids/qless-pool.pid`.

  * `-E, --environment` <name>:
    Specifies the environment <name> to be set for `RAILS_ENV`, `RACK_ENV`
    and `QLESS_ENV` which will be passed on to the pooled qless workers.

  * `--term-graceful-wait`:
    Configure TERM signal handling so the master will gracefully request worker
    shut downs (via `QUIT`) and wait for the workers to quit before shutting
    down itself.  This is the same behavior as the `QUIT` signal.

  * `--term-graceful`:
    Configure TERM signal handling so the master will gracefully request worker
    shut downs (via `QUIT`) but shut itself down immediately.  This the same
    behavior as the `INT` signal.

  * `--term-immediate`:
    Configure TERM signal handling so the master will request imediate worker
    shut downs (via `INT`) and shut itself down immediately.  This is the
    default `TERM` signal behavior.

## HISTORY

    Added appname for logging.<br>
    Minor bugfixes.

  * `v0.2.0`:
    Support for reloading logs and workers with `HUP` signal<br>
    Cleans up PID file on startup<br>
    Fixed `-c, --config` option.

  * `v0.1.0`:
    `qless-pool` command line interface added
